                <p>"This is my first time seeking advice from you." This is a peculiar letter.</p>
                <p>
                  I am Moon Rabbit, a female athlete. I have been selected as a candidate for next year‚Äôs Olympic Games.
                  I have a beloved boyfriend who understands, supports, and helps me, but he has suddenly fallen ill with cancer.
                  He tells me to focus entirely on my training and not to worry about him, but deep down, I want to be by his side.
                  I don't know what to do. Every day, I am lost in confusion, hoping you can guide me.

              Late at night, three young men‚ÄîAtsuya, Shota, and Kohei‚Äîcarrying stolen bags were attempting to escape in an old, battered car.
              However, the car broke down and wouldn‚Äôt start. With no other choice, they decided to take shelter in an abandoned building that Shota had previously discovered while scouting their escape route‚ÄîNamiya General Store.
            </p>
            <p>
              While searching inside the store, they were suddenly startled by the sound of a letter being dropped through the metal shutter's mail slot.
              The three opened the letter and discovered that it was a distress inquiry written by a female athlete under the pseudonym "Moon Rabbit."
              She sought advice on choosing between love and training.
            </p>
            <p>
              Atsuya insisted on ignoring the letter, but Shota and Kohei saw it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and decided to write a reply.
              To their surprise, "Moon Rabbit" sent another letter in response. Thus began an unexpected exchange of letters.

                <p>I am the only son of a family-run fish shop. My parents hope that I will take over the business, but my true passion is music.</p>
                <p>They have always opposed my pursuit of a music career, believing it to be reckless and not a stable profession.</p>
                <p>However, I truly love music. I have started performing in small bars and on the streets. Although the income is low, I enjoy this way of life.</p>
                <p>If I give up music and return to inherit the fish shop, my family will be happy, but will I regret it? Will my future self really feel at ease if I abandon my dreams?</p>

              Eight years ago, while attending university, Kurou took a leave of absence to pursue his passion for music.
              However, he faced constant setbacks in the industry and struggled to gain recognition.
            </p>
            <p>
              Meanwhile, his father back home was in poor health, and the family fish shop needed someone to take over.
              Caught between "chasing his dreams" and "accepting reality," Kurou was torn about what to do.
            </p>
            <p>
              He wrote a letter to Namiya General Store. The first response was harsh and blunt. Frustrated, he replied again and played harmonica in the night.
              To his surprise, a second, heartfelt response arrived ‚Äî one that would stay with him for life.

            He urged Yuji to close the shop and move in with him, hoping to provide better care.
            Yuji, who had continued responding to letters of concern, hesitated at first.

            One day, however, Yuji suddenly said it was time and agreed to close the store.

              <p>
               Greetings. I am a big Beatles fan. Recently, I heard that they might be disbanding and I feel very sad. The Beatles' music has always been with me and has given me a lot of comfort and strength.
              </p>
              <p>
               At the same time, the company my father runs is having problems and the family may be in financial trouble. I didn't know what the future would become, and I wasn't sure if I would still be able to listen to music and live the life I loved as freely as I did now.
              </p>
              <p>
               I feel very confused. How can I cope with these sudden ‚Äúlosses‚Äù? If the things I love so much are gone, should I still hold on to my original self? I hope you can give me some guidance.

               Hello, I am a nineteen year old girl currently working as an OL in a company.
               Every day's work is just photocopying, serving tea and listening to my boss's instructions, and I feel very bored. Is this life really meaningful? I don't know if I am fit to continue like this.
              </p>
              <p>
               Recently, someone invited me to be a ‚Äúrestaurant girl‚Äù, saying that I could dress beautifully and earn a lot of money, and that my life would look very glamorous. I was a bit tempted at first, but I wondered if that kind of work wasn't too serious.
              </p>
              <p>
               I'd like to hear your opinion. Do you think I should quit my current job and become a restaurant girl?

          </p>
          <p>
            The three of them think she is a frivolous girl and reply to the letter, but in the letter that follows, Bewildered Woof describes her situation in detail, and the three of them change their minds.
